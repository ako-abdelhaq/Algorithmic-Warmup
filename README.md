# Algorithmic Warm-up

  
In this repo, you find implementations of my solutions to some problems in Hackerrank. Topics include implementations of basic ideas in algorithms and some basic data structures array, dynamic array, linked list, stack, queue, priority queue, and more.

Every code file includes the statement of the solved problem and the solution's code. Solutions are written in C/C++.

Feel free to comment on the code and to report any issues.
